### Opus as a Turing Machine

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/785946312.svg)](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.10984859)

Given only a series of input tapes, Opus learns to compute solutions for the
A::B problem with 100% accuracy at 24 steps, and Rule 110 for a 12-token tape
over 12 steps (accuracy over large runs not yet measured).
